# 🧠 Algorithms & Data Structures – Project

This repository contains a collection of solved problems from **LeetCode**, categorized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. The purpose of this project was to practice and strengthen concepts learned during the *Algorithms and Data Structures* course.

## 📚 Course Context

This project was developed as part of the *Algorithms and Data Structures* course, where students were encouraged to solve algorithmic challenges regularly to:

- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Deepen understanding of time and space complexity.
- Practice classic data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, graphs, and more.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the difficulty level of the problems:
