# ðŸ“˜ Project: Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of selected LeetCode problems solved in **C++**, organized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. The project was developed as part of the university course **Algorithms and Data Structures**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project was to strengthen algorithmic thinking and gain a solid understanding of fundamental data structures through practical problem-solving.

Key objectives include:

- Time and space complexity analysis
- Implementation and usage of core data structures:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- Mastery of techniques such as:
  - Recursion and Backtracking
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Searching and Sorting
  - Two Pointers, Sliding Window
  - Depth-First and Breadth-First Search (DFS & BFS)
